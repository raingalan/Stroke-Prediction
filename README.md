# Stroke-Prediction

Using the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset), I aim to do the following:
1. Apply Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Use Resampling Techniques to address an imbalanced dataset
3. Hypertune Classification models to identify the presence of stroke and identify the best model.
