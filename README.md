# Stroke-Prediction

Using the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset), I aim to do the following:
1. Apply Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset
2. Preprocess the data for feeding into models (handle outliers, MinMaxScaling, Onehot Encoding, Train-test Split)
3. Use Resampling Techniques to address an imbalanced dataset
4. Hypertune Classification models to identify the presence of stroke and identify the best model.
